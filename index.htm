<h1>OG(H)AM:
Harnessing digital technologies to transform understanding of ogham writing,
from the 4th century to the 21st century <a href="https://ogham.glasgow.ac.uk/">(Project
website)</a></h1>

<p>Overview: The project will harness digital tools from different fields to transform 
scholarly and popular understanding of ogham—an ancient script unique to Ireland and 
Britain. This project provides the long-awaited opportunity to complete the corpus of 
ogham-inscribed Irish stones begun by the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies 
<a href="https://ogham.celt.dias.ie">Ogham 
in 3D project</a> (2012-15, 2016-17; created by White with our partner organisations, the 
Discovery Programme, and the Irish Government’s National Monuments Service) and to 
extend it to include oghams in all media, including the many outside the Republic of 
Ireland.</p>
